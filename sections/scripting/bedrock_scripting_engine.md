# Bedrock Scripting Engine

BDSX enables the Bedrock Scripting Engine as default and server-side scripts are supported. Scripts should be coded in "index.ts" located in BDSX directory.

Note: overriding `system.initialize` will not do anything as the system is already initialized, put codes inside it in global scope.
